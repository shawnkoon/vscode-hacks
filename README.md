## Turn off preview mode.

If you use vscode, you will notice vscode open files in preview mode by default.

> Notice the `Italic` texted file. Once you click on other file, it will disappear. 
<br/>
> This can get really `annoying when you are switching between files` multiple times.

**To fix this issue add following to `settings.json` file.**

```
"workbench.editor.enablePreview": false
```

<br/>

## Collapse Tree

In mid development, file tree structure can become a huge mess.

You can simply click on `4th icon` by the **Project Name** to collapse all folders at once.

## Installed Extensions

<br/>
